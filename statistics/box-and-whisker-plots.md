![A box & whisker plot shows a "box" with left edge at Q1 , right edge at Q3 , the "middle" of the box at Q2 (the median) and the maximum and minimum as "whiskers".](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-01-23-at-12.17.17-pm.png)

### Outliers in Box and Whisker Plots

The standard definition for an outlier is **the number which is less than Q1 or greater than Q3 by more than 1.5 times the interquartile range** ( IQR=Q3−Q1 ).

![An outlier is any number less than Q1−(1.5×IQR) or greater than Q3+(1.5×IQR).](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-01-23-at-12.19.27-pm.png)
