# Box and Whisker Plots

{% hint style="success" %}
Box plot is a tool to visually represent the range, interquartile range, median, mode, outliers, and all quartiles.
{% endhint %}

![A box &amp; whisker plot shows a &quot;box&quot; with left edge at Q1 , right edge at Q3 , the &quot;middle&quot; of the box at Q2 \(the median\) and the maximum and minimum as &quot;whiskers&quot;.](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-01-23-at-12.17.17-pm.png)

### Outliers in Box and Whisker Plots

The standard definition for an outlier is **the number which is less than Q1 or greater than Q3 by more than 1.5 times the interquartile range** \( IQR=Q3−Q1 \).

![An outlier is any number less than Q1&#x2212;\(1.5&#xD7;IQR\) or greater than Q3+\(1.5&#xD7;IQR\).](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-01-23-at-12.19.27-pm.png)
