# Random Variable

{% hint style="success" %}
A random variable is a variable that is subject to randomness, which means it can take on different values.
{% endhint %}

* In statistics, it is normal to use an `X` to denote a random variable.&#x20;
* The random variable takes on different values depending on the situation.
* Each value of the random variable has a probability or percentage associated with it.

### Discrete Random Variables

A discrete random variable is a variable that represents numbers found by counting. For example, number of marbles in a jar, number of students present or number of heads when tossing two coins.

{% hint style="info" %}
X is discrete because the numbers that X represents are isolated points on the number line.
{% endhint %}

The number of heads that can come up when tossing two coins is a discrete random variable because heads can only come up a certain number of times: 0, 1, or 2. Also, we want to know the probability associated with each value of the random values.

![A probability distribution for the number of heads (our random variable) when you toss two coins.](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-03-at-2.23.54-pm.png)

A probability distribution has all the possible values of the random variable and the associated probabilities.&#x20;

### Continuous Random Variables

{% hint style="success" %}
When we have to use intervals for our random variable or all values in an interval are possible, we call it a continuous random variable.
{% endhint %}

Thus, continuous random variables are random variables that are found from measuring - like the height of a group of people or distance traveled while grocery shopping or student test scores.

{% hint style="info" %}
In this case, X is continuous because X represents an infinite number of values on the number line.
{% endhint %}

Like the coin example, the random variable (in this case, the intervals) would have certain probabilities or percentages associated with it. And this would be a probability distribution for the test scores.

In the study of probability, we are interested in finding the probabilities associated with each value of these random variables.

**Sum of Probabilities for a Distribution**\
On the above, in each table, the sum of all probabilities add up to 1 or 100%. However, for continuous random variables, we can construct a histogram of the table with relative frequencies, and the area under the histogram is also equal to 1.
