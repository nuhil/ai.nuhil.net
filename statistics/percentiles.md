# Percentiles

{% hint style="success" %}
The value below which a percentage of data falls.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are the fourth tallest person in a group of 20, then 80% of people are shorter than you. That means you are at the 80th percentile. If your height is 1.85m then "1.85m" is the 80th percentile height in that group.
{% endhint %}

Each dataset has **three quartiles**, which are the percentiles that divide the dataset into **four** **parts:**

* **First Quartile** is the sample 25th percentile. It divides roughly 25% of the smallest items from the rest of the dataset.
* **Second Quartile** is the sample 50th percentile or the median. Approximately 25% of the items lie between the first and second quartiles and another 25% between the second and third quartiles.
* **Third Quartile** is the sample 75th percentile. It divides roughly 25% of the largest items from the rest of the dataset.
