# Joint Probability

{% hint style="success" %}
Joint probability is the probability of two events happening together.
{% endhint %}

The two events are usually designated event A and event B. In probability terminology, it can be written as:

$$
P(A \cap B) =P(A,B) = P(A|B)*P(B)
$$

Anyway, if an event A and B are idenpendent then $$P(A|B) = P(A)$$, and therefore, $$P(A \cap B) = P(A,B)$$ become $$P(A) * P(B)$$&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** The probability that a card is a five and black = p(five and black)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

2/52 = 1/26\
(There are two black fives in a deck of 52 cards, the five of spades and the five of clubs).

### OR Events

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)
$$
